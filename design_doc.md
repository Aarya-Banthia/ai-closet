# AI Closet App Design Doc

## 1. Introduction

This design document outlines the implementation plan for the AI Closet Mobile App, a React Native application built with Expo to support both iOS and Android devices. The app aims to help users manage their clothes, create stylish outfits, and virtually try on clothes using AI-powered features like automatic clothing categorization, background removal, and virtual try-on capabilities.

Target Users:

- Fashion-conscious individuals and style enthusiasts interested in creating and sharing outfit ideas.
- Online shoppers who want to visualize clothing items before purchasing.

## 2. Features

1. Clothing Management:

   - Add, view, and categorize clothing items with AI assistance
   - Automatic background removal and clothing categorization
   - Custom tagging, attributes management and organization options

2. Outfit Management:

   - Create, save, and manage outfits using clothing items
   - Outfit collage creation, which provides user an empty canvas and user can drag-and-move different clothing items on the canvas to create outfits
   - Tagging and categorization of outfits

3. Virtual Try-On:
   - Allow users to virtually try on clothes using their photos
   - User can choose to try-on: individual items from the closet, or upload items from the user’s photo albums

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers:

- UI Layer: Handles the presentation and user interaction, built with React Native components.
- State Management Layer: Manages global state using React Context API.
- Data Layer: Handles data storage and retrieval using AsyncStorage and expo-file-system for local data.
- Service Layer: Manages interactions with third-party APIs for AI functionalities.
- Navigation Layer: Manages screen transitions using React Navigation.

Component Interaction Flow:

- User Interaction: User interacts with UI components (e.g., adds a clothing item).
- State Update: UI components dispatch actions to update the global state via Context API.
- Data Persistence: Changes in state trigger updates to local storage.
- API Services: When AI features are needed, service calls are made to third-party APIs.
- UI Update: Responses from APIs update the state, which in turn updates the UI.

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 UI/UX Design

Overall Layout:

- Tabs at the bottom of the screen for Clothing Management, Outfit Management, and Virtual Try-On

1. Clothing Management Screens:

   1.1 All Clothing Items Screen:

   Layout:

   - Top bar with "My Closet" title and a filter icon
   - Horizontal scrolling clothing item category tabs: All, Tops, Bottoms, Dresses, Outerwear
   - Tag section below categories, showing custom tags for quick filtering (e.g., Summer Favorites, Workwear)
   - Main content area with a grid layout of clothing item thumbnails (1:1 aspect ratio), 3 items per row
   - Bottom navigation bar with icons for Closet, Outfits, Try-On, and Profile

   Components:

   - Filter button in the top bar for sorting/filtering options
   - Category tabs for quick filtering
   - Tag chips for quick additional custom filtering
   - Clothing item thumbnails, showing the item on a neutral background
   - Add floating action button (yellow circle with "+" sign) in the bottom right corner
   - Navigation bar at the bottom

   Interactions:

   - Tapping category tabs filters the displayed items
   - Tapping tag chips applies additional filters
   - Tapping a clothing item thumbnail opens the item details screen
   - Tapping the add floating action button initiates the process of adding a new item:
     - The background dims, and 3 button options appear:
       - "Choose from Photos" button with gallery icon - tapping opens the device's photo gallery
       - "Camera" button with camera icon - tapping activates the device's camera for taking a new photo
       - "Cancel" button with an "x" icon - tapping dismisses the add item process
       - Post-tap actions:
         - If the user selects an image from the gallery or takes a photo, the background removal and AI categorization process starts, and the user is directed to the Clothing Item Detail Screen to review and edit the item attributes.
         - If the user cancels, the background returns to normal.
     - Animation: When the user taps the Add Button, the following happens simultaneously:
       - the background (clothing grid) becomes slightly dimmed to focus attention on the action options.
       - two additional buttons (for “Choose from Photos” and “Camera”) emerge from the original Add Button

### 4.2 Data Management

- AsyncStorage: Used for storing structured data like JSON representations of ClothingItems, Outfits, and TryOnSessions.
- expo-file-system: Used for storing image files locally on the device.

Data Persistence Strategy:

- When a new item is added or updated, the corresponding data model is serialized to JSON and stored in AsyncStorage.
- Image files are stored using expo-file-system, and their URIs are referenced in the data models.
- Data retrieval is handled asynchronously, loading from AsyncStorage and file system upon app launch or when needed.

#### 4.2.1 Data Models

1. Clothing Item Model:

   - id: string (uuid)
   - imageUri: string
   - backgroundRemovedImageUri: string
   - createdAt: string
   - updatedAt: string
   - category: string (Tops, Bottoms, Dresses, Outerwear)
   - subcategory: string (e.g., T-shirts, Jeans, Skirts, Jackets)
   - tags: string[] (custom tags, e.g., Summer Favorites, Workwear)
   - color: string[]
   - season: string[] (Spring/Fall, Summer, Winter)
   - occasion: string[] (Casual, Work, Formal, Party, Sports)
   - brand: string
   - purchaseDate: string (formatted date)
   - price: number

2. Outfit Model:

   - id: string (uuid)
   - imageUri: string
   - createdAt: string
   - updatedAt: string
   - clothingItems: string[] (references to included clothing item ids)
   - tags: string[] (custom tags, e.g., Summer Looks, Date Night)
   - season: string[] (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)
   - occasion: string[] (Casual, Work, Formal, Party)

3. Virtual Try-On Model:
   - id: string (uuid)
   - createdAt: string
   - updatedAt: string
   - tryOnType: string (Single Closet Item, Discover & Try, Complete Outfits)
   - clothingItemId: string (reference to the selected clothing item id)
   - outfitId: string (reference to the selected outfit id)
   - newClothingImageUri: string (user-uploaded photo for try-on, for Discover & Try option)
   - userPhotoUri: string
   - resultImageUri: string

#### 4.2.2 State Management

- Use React Context and hooks (if applicable) for global state management to avoid prop drilling and provide state access across the app.

- Contexts:

  - ClothingContext: Manages clothing items.
  - OutfitContext: Manages outfits.
  - TryOnContext: Manages try-on sessions.

- Actions:
  - Add, Update, Delete operations for each data model.
  - Load Initial Data: Fetch data from AsyncStorage on app startup.

### 4.3 Additional Implementation Details

1. Centralize colors and common styles in `/src/styles` for consistent theming

2. Break down UI elements into reusable components

3. Implement navigation using React Navigation for seamless transitions between screens

4. Use Expo Camera and ImagePicker APIs for capturing photos and selecting images
