AI Closet is a mobile application that brings an AI-powered approach to closet management and styling. Whether you want to keep track of every piece in your closet, or seek an easy way to visualize outfit ideas, the AI Closet helps you:

   - Experiment with outfit combinations and save your favorite looks for future inspiration.
   - Preview how items/outfits (even from online stores) might look on you using virtual try-on technology.
